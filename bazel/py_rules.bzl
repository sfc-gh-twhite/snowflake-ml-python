"""py_{binary|libary|test} rules for snowml repository.

Overriding default implementation of py_{binary|library|test} to add additional features:
1. Codebase is split between 'src' & 'tests' top-level directories. We did not want python import with
   'src.snowflake.ml...'. We just want 'snowflake.ml....'. Hence I added to add additional imports statements
   to `py_library`.
2. Added check so that a target in `src` cannot depend on something in `tests`.
3. Similarly, added a check that a non-experimental target cannot depend on `experimental` target.
4. A boolean attribute "compatible_with_snowpark" is available in all the wrapped rules.
   The value of this flag affects which platform (semantically a platform maps to a conda
   environment; there are two platforms -- a snowflake channel only environment and an extended
   environment) is valid for a target. The choice of platform also affect the Python toolchain (the
   actual conda environment used to build, run and test, see WORKSPACE).
   - Targets that has compatible_with_snowpark=False, or has any (transitive)
     dependency whose compatible_with_snowpark is False, can only be built with
     //bazel/platforms:extended_conda_env.
   - All other targets can be built with either //bazel/platforms:extended_conda_env or
     //bazel/platforms:snowflake_conda_env
   - None of the target can be built with the host platform (@local_config_platform//:host). However
     that platform is not the default platform (see .bazelrc).

    Additional import is necessary to expose a libray outside of top-level src directory. For example,
    by defining `//src/snowflake/ml/utils:connection_params` as follows:
    ```
    py_libary(
        name = "connection_params",
        srcs = ["connection_params.py"],
        imports = ["../../.."],
        deps = [],
    )
    ```
    make the library available at the top-level, which is default `PYTHONPATH` under `bazel`. Now, `connection_params`
    is visible to anyone as `snowflake.ml.utils.connection_params`. This rule automates the generation of additional
    imports based current package's depth.
