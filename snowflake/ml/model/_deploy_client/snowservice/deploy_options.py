        When updated, please ensure the type hint is updated accordingly at: //snowflake/ml/model/type_hints

            compute_pool: SnowService compute pool name. Please refer to official doc for how to create a
                compute pool: https://docs.snowflake.com/LIMITEDACCESS/snowpark-containers/reference/compute-pool
            image_repo: SnowService image repo path. e.g. "<image_registry>/<db>/<schema>/<repo>". Default to auto
                inferred based on session information.
            min_instances: Minimum number of service replicas. Default to 1.
            max_instances: Maximum number of service replicas. Default to 1.
            prebuilt_snowflake_image: When provided, the image-building step is skipped, and the pre-built image from
                Snowflake is used as is. This option is for users who consistently use the same image for multiple use
                cases, allowing faster deployment. The snowflake image used for deployment is logged to the console for
                future use. Default to None.
            num_gpus: Number of GPUs to be used for the service. Default to 0.
            num_workers: Number of workers used for model inference. Please ensure that the number of workers is set
                lower than the total available memory divided by the size of model to prevent memory-related issues.
                Default is number of CPU cores * 2 + 1.
            enable_remote_image_build: When set to True, will enable image build on a remote SnowService job.
                Default is False.
