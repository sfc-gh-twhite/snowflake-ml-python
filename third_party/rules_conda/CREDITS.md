# Credits

Special thanks to [Sebastian Pietras](https://github.com/spietras) for authoring [rules_conda](
    https://spietras.github.io/rules_conda/) for Bazel.

This package has been forked from his [rules_conda codebase](https://github.com/spietras/rules_conda/tree/main) and
 modified to cater specific need of this Snowflake repo.
